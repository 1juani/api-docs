# Welcome

Hey! Glad to see you are interested in integrating with Zerion. We've built an [interface](https://app.zerion.io?utm_medium=docs&utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=api&utm_content=external&utm_term=web) that offers the easiest and simplest way for DeFi investors to manage their portfolio, and we're happy to share the tools that made that possible. Find some options below on how we can work together. If you need some inspiration, check out our [Featured Partners](featured-partners.md) section.

## Integrate Zerion API in your app

If you are looking to integrate Zerion's API into your dapp or application, head over to the [Websocket API](websockets/getting-started/) section. There, you will find examples of how to connect to Zerion and fetch information for Ethereum wallet addresses, protocols and tokens.
